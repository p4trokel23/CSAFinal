  * the goal is to geuss the equation based on the numbers input 
  * (limitations on input?)
  * 
  * equation will be generated randomly but the 
  * length and complexity will depend on the level. all equations wil
  * include a varible x which will be input by the user. x may not 
  * exist for the first level. score for a level will be determined 
  * by number of geusses, number of inputs, and level. if the player 
  * tries to imput nonnessicarry text or they imput the same number 
  * four times in a row the game will end. there is no limit on 
  * incorrect geusses, but there wil be a code for the player to quit 
  * at any time.  
    
    the player will be given instructions and then will have the
    option to enter text. they can either enter a geuss in the form 
    of an equation,a number which will be put into the equation, or 
    the code to quite the game. incompleted games will not be saved
